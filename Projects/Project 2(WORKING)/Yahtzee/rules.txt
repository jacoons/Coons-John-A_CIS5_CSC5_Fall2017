-----------------------------Game Rules---------------------------------
This game can be played by more people than you will ever be able to get
together for Yahtzee.  The game is relatively easy and striaght forward.
There are 13 rounds total.  One round consists of each player rolling 3 
times.  After each roll the player chooses which dice to keep and then 
rolls the remaining dice.  A round is considered to be over when all 
players have rolled 3 times.  The object of the game is to obtain as 
many scoring combinations as possible; you can only score once per

once). The scoring combinations are below:
